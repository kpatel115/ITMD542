Will need to install dependencies again,

Then after everything is installed, run

The server will start, onto your web browser log onto localhost:3000 and the web app will start for you.

## Insight and Results

I learned how to create RESTful API patterns and use GET and POST in order to get data to be sent back from the localhost server. I learned about the pug language and can see that it is similar to handlebars. I also am able to say that i have gotten familiar with filesystems, maps, different methods and back end work.

I did have trouble displaying contact data, but this was a syntax issue with pug.

I wish I was able to work on the styling more...
